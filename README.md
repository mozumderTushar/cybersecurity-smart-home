# Cybersecurity Threats for Smart-Home: An Experimental Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains the research paper "Cybersecurity Threats for Smart-Home: An Experimental Analysis". The study explores the cybersecurity threats posed to smart homes and proposes a risk mitigation framework to enhance the safety and privacy of connected gadgets.

## Abstract
Smart homes, automated towns, and intelligent modes of transportation are examples of extremely dynamic, cyber-connected operational settings that are being built and used more and more. For a security study of such a changing environment, we need to use dynamic risk assessment methods and model states that are changing all the time. This research is significant because it gives a comprehensive strategy for protecting internet-connected houses from attackers. The proposed risk mitigation framework can guide the development of new security measures and technologies for smart homes, thereby enhancing the safety and privacy of their connected gadgets.
